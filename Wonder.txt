Wonder Project J[b] is a 1994 life simulation video game developed
 by Almanic Corporation and published by Enix for the Super Famicom.
 In the game, players take care of a boy Gijin (robot) created by
 Dr. Geppetto named Pino. Directed by Takashi Yoneda, the title was
 created by most of the same personnel that worked on previous projects
 at Almanic such as E.V.O.: Search for Eden. It was met with positive 
reception from critics and sold over 1.3 million copies in Japan, 
making it one of the best-selling Super Famicom games. A sequel, 
Wonder Project J2, was released in 1996 for the Nintendo 64.
